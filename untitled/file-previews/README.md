# Previews

Both the [stemn.com](https://stemn.com) website and [stemn desktop](../../stemn-desktop.md) app support a variety of different file previews. Most importantly, you can preview and explore pretty much any type of CAD model. This is particularly useful if you need to share a preview of your files with a team member or client that doesn't necessarily have the correct software installed.

## Supported file previewers:

{% page-ref page="cad.md" %}

{% page-ref page="code.md" %}

{% page-ref page="images.md" %}

{% page-ref page="documents.md" %}

{% page-ref page="misc.md" %}

{% page-ref page="pcb-+-gerber.md" %}
