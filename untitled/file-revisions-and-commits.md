# Revisions

## What is a Revision?

A revision is simply a previous version of a file. Every time a file sync to Stemn through your Dropbox or Google drive, we save a version if it on our secure servers. This means you'll have a full history of every change you and your team have made to your project files.

## How to access revisions

You can access the file revisions from both the [stemn.com](http://stemn.com) website and the desktop application.
