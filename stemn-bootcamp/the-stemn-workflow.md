# The Stemn Workflow

The Stemn Workflow is the way we suggest you manage collaboration and file management. It involves creating [task threads ](../task-tracking.md)and then linking them to your file changes through [commits](../files-and-syncing/commits.md). This simple process allows you and your teammates to keep track of what tasks were completed and when. You can then easily compare files before and after each task was completed.

* Create a task thread from either the website or desktop. Describe the task you need to do.
* Once you have completed your task, [create a commit](../files-and-syncing/commits.md#how-are-they-created) from the desktop app and link it in the commit description.

After creating a commit with a thread link, a link to the commit will appear in the thread's history so your teammates can see which files have changed and how.
