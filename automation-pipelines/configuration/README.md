# Pipeline configuration

## Meet the `*.pipeline` file

All of the configuration for your Automation Pipeline is contained within a `*.pipeline` file which is stored along side your other project files. There are 3 main concepts you need to understand before you can get going with your first `.pipeline` file:

{% page-ref page="triggers.md" %}

{% page-ref page="stages.md" %}

{% page-ref page="steps/" %}

If you understand these 3 concepts, you're ready to write your first pipeline configuration. FYI, you can have multiple `.pipeline` files in your project and even multiple in a single folder. Just call them different things such as `render.pipeline` or `document.pipeline`
