# Custom Step Images

## When to create a custom image?

First, you should browse through the catalog of [stemn ](stemn-steps.md)and [3rd party images](3rd-party-steps.md). If what you need to do is not there or is very niche or proprietary, you'll probably need to create your own image.

Keep in mind, if you just want to execute some code, you can use a base operating system image such as [alpine ](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/alpine/)or [ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) and then run using the step command field.
