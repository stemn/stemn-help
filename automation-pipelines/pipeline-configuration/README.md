# Pipeline configuration

## Meet the `*.pipeline` file

All of the configuration for your Automation Pipeline is contained within the `*.pipeline` file which is stored along side your other project files.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
