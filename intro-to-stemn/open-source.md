# Open Source

## What is Open Engineering?

Great engineering is the result of constant iteration and relentless refinement. The best ideas grow and expand with the input of others. 

Open engineering is not just about the final result, it's about sharing your process. It's about the hours of missteps, the false starts, the frustration and anguish you pushed through, before arriving at the final iteration. 

Each of those false starts is a learning experience, a teachable moment to invite others to understand not just your solution; but how you did so. 

## Engineering is lagging

Unfortunately, engineering has fallen far behind other fields like software development. Proprietary, closed-source work has become the industry standard. This may seem like an inevitability of doing business but the world of software has proven it isn't the only way. These days, large software companies such as Google and Facebook open-source (make freely available) a significant portion of their R&D. Why don't we do the same with engineering? Imagine the pace of technical improvement if humanity spent more time working together rather than competing and re-inventing the wheel.

## Open Source Engineering on Stemn

At Stemn, **we love open source.** That is why we have a special open-source pricing plan. If your project is open source, we give you access to [automation pipelines](../automation-pipelines/) and [infinite revision history](../files-and-syncing/revisions.md) for **free**!

Have a [browse ](https://stemn.com/explore)of the open source projects on Stemn and see what you can learn.

Our software is of course open source. If you want to contribute, check us out on GitHub.
